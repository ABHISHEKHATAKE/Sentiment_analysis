# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis using NLP and Deep Learning

This project implements a **Sentiment Analysis** model using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Deep Learning** techniques. It classifies text (e.g., product reviews, tweets) into positive or negative sentiments. The model is trained on labeled datasets using embedding layers, LSTMs/GRUs, or CNNs for text understanding.
